# livestream_dl

A robust YouTube livestream downloader that combines the reliability of [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) with the fragment-based downloading principles of [ytarchive](https://github.com/Kethsar/ytarchive).

This tool focuses on using `yt-dlp` for stream information extraction, ensuring compatibility with YouTube's changing infrastructure. It is designed to handle live recording with the ability to recover streams if they become unavailable (e.g., go private) during the download process.

## Key Features

* **Robust Downloading:** Uses `yt-dlp` for extraction, minimizing breakage from YouTube updates.
* **Stream Recovery:** capable of recovering streams that go private during recording (requires specific configuration).
* **Dual Write Modes:** Supports both direct `.ts` file writing (low disk IO) and SQLite-backed downloading (safer for unstable connections).
* **Live Chat:** Integrated support for downloading live chat (via `yt-dlp` or `chat-downloader`) and bundling it into a ZIP file.
* **Channel Monitoring:** Automated monitoring of channels for upcoming or live streams.
* **Protocol Fallbacks:** Optional support for DASH and HLS (m3u8) protocols to avoid modifying `yt-dlp` source code.

## Important: Modification of yt-dlp (No longer required with yt-dlp releases after 2026.2.21

**Note:** This step is required **only** if you want to use the default adaptive stream URLs which support private stream recovery. If you prefer not to modify files, you can use the `--dash` or `--m3u8` flags (see Options below), though these have limitations regarding recovery.

To enable adaptive stream URLs that allow for private stream recovery, the `yt-dlp` youtube extractor must be modified to save formats that are usually discarded.

1.  Find the location of `yt-dlp`:
    ```bash
    pip show yt-dlp
    ```
2.  Open `yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/_video.py`.
3.  a) Replace `if fmt_stream.get('targetDurationSec'):` with `if fmt_stream.get('targetDurationSec') and not 'live_adaptive' in format_types:` (experimental patch to hopefully push to core yt-dlp), or
    b) Comment out or remove the following lines (approx line 3467):
    ```python
    if fmt_stream.get('targetDurationSec'):
        continue
    ```

**Linux `sed` command (As of Nov 2025):**
```bash
sed -i "/if[[:space:]]\+fmt_stream\.get('targetDurationSec'):/,/^[[:space:]]*continue/s/^[[:space:]]*/&#/" "$(pip show yt-dlp | awk '/Location/ {print $2}')/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/_video.py"

```

---

## Usage

Execute `runner.py` with Python.

```bash
python runner.py [OPTIONS] [VIDEO_URL_OR_ID]

```

### Examples

**Basic download:**

```bash
python runner.py --threads 4 --dash --m3u8 --write-thumbnail --embed-thumbnail --wait-for-video "60:600" --clean-info-json --remove-ip-from-json --live-chat --resolution "best" --write-info-json --log-level "INFO" -- "[VIDEO_ID]"

```

**Download with live chat and embed thumbnail:**

```bash
python runner.py --live-chat --threads 4 --embed-thumbnail VIDEO_ID

```

**Monitor a channel for streams:**

```bash
python runner.py --monitor-channel --threads 4 --dash --m3u8 --wait-for-video 60 CHANNEL_ID

```

  --ipv6                Force IPv6 only (default: False)
  --stop-chat-when-done STOP_CHAT_WHEN_DONE
                        Wait a maximum of X seconds after a stream is finished to download live chat. This is useful if waiting for chat to end causes hanging. Onl works with chat-downloader live chat downloads. (type: int) (default: 300)
  --new-line            Console messages always print to new line. (Currently only ensured for stats output) (default: False)

Channel Monitor Options:
  --monitor-channel     Use monitor channel feature (Alpha). Specify channel ID in 'ID' argument (e.g. UCxsZ6NCzjU_t4YSxQLBcM5A). Not using the channel ID will attempt to resolve the channel ID. (default: False)
  --members-only        Monitor 'Members Only' playlist for streams instead of 'Streams' playlist. Requires cookies. (default: False)
  --upcoming-lookahead UPCOMING_LOOKAHEAD
                        Maximum time (in hours) to start a downloader instance for a video. (type: int) (default: 24)

## Downloader methods

There are two download methods available for livestream downloading, using a SQLite database and writing directly to a ts file. For stream recovery, only the SQLite option is available. Merging to a video or audio file (.mp4, .mkv, .ogg etc) will require an extra write of information. The default method is the SQLite method.

### Direct writing to a .ts file

Writing directly to a ts file helps reduce the number of writes to a disk during the recording as it is only necessary to write to the final ts file. This may reduce disk wear over a long period of time of downloading many streams.
As segments are downloaded, the sequence number of the segment is used to decide which segment will be appended to the ts file next. If the "next" segment is not available to be written to the disk, other segments will be stored in RAM until the respective previous segment has been written to the disk. This performs in a similar way to [ytarchive](https://github.com/Kethsar/ytarchive).
To reduce file opening and closing actions on the file system, if multiple sequential segments can be written at once, they will be written into the file at once.
A state file is saved each time segments are written to the disk, saving the latest segment and size of the file, so the downloader doesn't need to re-download segments should the downloading session stop for any reason.
Segment downloads are not guaranteed to finish in a sequential order if more than 1 thread is used. If a segment is particularly slow at downloading, this may increase ram usage significantly while subsequent segments are saved in RAM.

For regular livestream recording that doesn't experience frequent segment download errors, using the direct writing method will work well.

### SQLite

The SQLite downloader method is used to improve handling of non-sequential successful segment downloads. This works by creating and using a basic table of the segment number as an ID and a blob to store the segment data. Once all segments are downloaded, a query is executed to sort all of the downloaded segments into the correct order and saved to a .ts file. This helps significantly to manage downloaded segments when failures occur often, such as unavailable stream recovery. By writing to the database and a final .ts file, this will require 2 full writes of the downloaded data, which may increase wear on flash-based systems. For most users, this increased wear will not be significant in the long-term.
This improves over saving individual segment files like [ytarchive-raw-go](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Kethsar/ytarchive%5D(https://github.com/HoloArchivists/ytarchive-raw-go)) as all the downloaded segments are encapsilated into a single file, making it easier for the file system to handle.
In the SQLite method, the existence of a downloaded segment is checked before it is downloaded. This allows failed segments to be "looped back to" later without causing other slowdowns, and ensures some information is saved for a segment (even if it is empty, as is the case sometimes).

## Known Issues

* **Concurrent Futures:** The downloader uses `concurrent.futures` for thread management. While robust, stopping the downloader gracefully (e.g., via Keyboard Interrupt) can sometimes be delayed if a thread is stuck on a request.
* **Stream Recovery:** This feature is currently in a "semi-broken" state and may not work reliably for all stream types.
* **Chat Downloader:** The `chat-downloader` dependency occasionally breaks due to YouTube updates; the tool may fall back to `yt-dlp` for chat extraction which has different output formatting.
